#This code contains two parts: an Arduino sketch (C++) and an Android app (Java) that work together to create a pet feeder controlled through the internet using Firebase Realtime Database.

The Arduino sketch controls a servo motor to feed the pet, while the Android app allows the user to log in and control the feeder remotely.

Arduino sketch (C++):

Imports necessary libraries for Firebase Realtime Database, Wi-Fi, and Servo Motor control.
Sets Wi-Fi, Firebase API Key, and user credentials.
Defines a Firebase Data object, Firebase Auth, and Firebase Config objects.
Initializes the Servo motor on pin 4.
Sets up the Wi-Fi connection in the setup() function.
Initializes the Firebase library and sets up the automatic Wi-Fi reconnection.
Sets the Firebase token status callback function.
In the loop() function, checks if the Firebase is ready and if 5 seconds have passed. If true, it reads the "FEED_STATUS" value from the Firebase Realtime Database. If the value is true, it moves the servo motor to the 0-degree position (feeding), updates the "FEED_STATUS" to false, and sets the servo motor back to the 90-degree position (not feeding).
Android app (Java):

Imports necessary libraries for Firebase Authentication and Android app components.
Declares UI elements such as email, password input fields, login button, progress bar, and register text view.
Initializes the FirebaseAuth instance.
In the onStart() method, checks if a user is already logged in. If true, opens the MainActivity and finishes the Login activity.
In the onCreate() method, sets up UI elements and OnClickListener events for the register TextView and login button.
When the login button is clicked, it validates the email and password input, then uses the FirebaseAuth instance to sign in with the provided email and password.
If the login is successful, it opens the MainActivity and finishes the Login activity. If it fails, a toast message is displayed.
In summary, this code controls a pet feeder by actuating a servo motor based on the value of "FEED_STATUS" in the Firebase Realtime Database. The Android app allows the user to log in and control the feeder remotely by updating the "FEED_STATUS" value.

Servo library
Arduino core library
WiFi library for ESP8266
WiFi library for ESP32
Firebase ESP32 library
Firebase ESP8266 library
Firebase ESP Client library for PICO_RP2040
TokenHelper.h and RTDBHelper.h from the Firebase ESP Client library
How it works:

Connect to the Wi-Fi network using the provided credentials.
Authenticate and connect to the Firebase Realtime Database using the API key, database URL, and user credentials.
In the main loop, check if the Firebase connection is ready and if it's time to send data.
Retrieve the value of "/test/FEED_STATUS" from the Firebase Realtime Database.
If the value is true, turn on the servo motor by setting its angle to 0 degrees and set "/test/FEED_STATUS" to false.
If the value is false, turn off the servo motor by setting its angle to 90 degrees.
Increment a global count variable.
